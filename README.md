# 🌍 Tectonix - Seismic Risk & Disaster Management Platform

**Tectonix** is an integrated seismic risk and disaster management platform designed to bridge the gap between building owners, structural engineers, and emergency responders. It focuses on seismic risk assessment, real-time ground vibration monitoring, and coordinated disaster response for urban areas like Dhaka.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🤖 AI Structural Scanner:** Analyze building images to detect cracks, soft-story risks, and calculate structural integrity scores.
* **📡 Real-Time Seismic Mode:** IoT-driven dashboard visualizing ground motion (PGA), epicenter triangulation, and automated "Drop, Cover, Hold On" alerts.
* **🚨 Rescue Coordination:** Live tracking of distress beacons and coordination of first responder missions.
* **🏗️ Building Asset Manager:** Digital twin management for owners, including ownership history, retrofit cost estimation, and soil liquefaction data.
* **🔐 Role-Based Access:** Specialized interfaces for five user types: Specialists, Owners, First Responders, Volunteers, and Citizens.
